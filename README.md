# qualco-backend-2

I have created only tha backend implementation using spring boot 2.2.0.RELEASE written in java 11.
For the purpose of the database I have used mariadb and flyway for the migration and versioning of the database.
I have also used caching with caffeine.
I have added some dockerization , a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml. Now it only works for database container.
I have added a postman collection with the apis that I have created.
